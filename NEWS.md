# tulpaObs NEWS

## Unreleased

* feat(formula): lme4 bar syntax now supports the slope-only, multi-slope, and
  nested/crossed grouping forms (gcol33/tulpaObs#10):
  - `(1 + x + z | g)` stacks several random slopes into one correlated block
    (`re()` accepts a covariate matrix; `build_re_spec()` derives `n_coefs`
    from the slope-matrix width instead of hardcoding two).
  - `(0 + x | g)` is a slope-only block with no group intercept (threaded
    through tulpa's new `re_has_intercept` flag; requires tulpa >= ABI 22).
  - `(1 | g:h)` groups over the interaction factor; `(1 | g/h)` expands to one
    `re()` per implied grouping factor (`g`, `g:h`), distributing the LHS
    slopes across each. `||` makes the block's covariance diagonal.
  Recovery tests cover a 3x3 correlated intercept+2-slope block and a
  slope-only block under NUTS (`tests/testthat/test-re-bar-recovery.R`).

* fix(re): the correlated-slope Cholesky factor is now sized `k*(k-1)/2`
  (strictly-lower triangle) to match tulpa's tanh-Cholesky prior, replacing an
  oversized `k*(k+1)/2` that left `k` unconstrained parameters per term.

* fix(data): `tobs_data()` output composes with `tobs(visit_data = ...)`
  (gcol33/tulpaObs#8). A `det.covs` named list of `[N, J]` matrices is now
  reshaped internally to the visit-level detection design instead of erroring
  with `object '<covariate>' not found`, giving the visit-level-detection path
  a clean public route. Recovery test in
  `tests/testthat/test-issue8-visit-detection.R`.
